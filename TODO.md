### How frontend will work

- Select address
- Select the pools (initially only from uniswap, then add other dexes)
- See balances of all tokens, pool fraction, total value in a chosen token

### What we need on backend

- Db with pool data (for selecting the pools from search + dropdown)
- The rest can be queried from the frontend from alchemy
